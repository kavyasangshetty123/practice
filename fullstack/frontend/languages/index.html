    <h1 style="color: purple;">All languages</h1>
    <p>A computer cannot understand human languages directly. So, we need a language to communicate with a computer. We developed several languages as a method of computer communications. Simply, the languages which are used to communicate with a computer are called computer languages.</p><br>
    <h2>HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>CSS(Cascade Style Sheet)</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
    <h2>Java Script</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that web developers commonly use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games. Developers generally use JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS The scripting language works well with CSS in formatting HTML elements.</p>
    <h2>Type Script</h2>
    <p>TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match. For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not. TypeScript uses compile time type checking.</p><br>
