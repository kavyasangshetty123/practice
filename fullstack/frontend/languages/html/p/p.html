    <p>paragraph is nothing but some text and it is a block.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <p>INLINE: Inline elements are displayed on the same line. They do not start on a new line and take up only as much width as their contents require. An example of an inline element is the span tag.</p>
