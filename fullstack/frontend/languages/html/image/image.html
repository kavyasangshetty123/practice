    <h1 style="color: purple;">image tag</h1>
    <p>The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag takes several attributes, of which src, height, width, and alt are the most important.</p>
    
        <p>The src Attribute: The src attribute signifies the image source. Without it, the tag itself wouldn't be functional in the real world.</p>
              
        <p>The alt Attribute: The alt attribute specifies an alternative text for the image. This could be the text that shows during a network failure, for example. Or it could display something when the image source is wrongly specified, so users know what the image is about.</p>
